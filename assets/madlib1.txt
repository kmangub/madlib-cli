Make Me A Video Game!

I the silly  and smelly Kira have cried Calvin's fragrant sister and plan to steal her merry farts!

What are a elephant and backpacking quokka to do? Before you can help Daisy, you'll have to collect the funny flowers and wonky cars that open up the 23 worlds connected to A Calvin's Lair. There are 70 candles and 10 cows in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
